### My Journey So Far

I've been interested in Technology for some time. It's always been a world of magic and possibility to me. For the longest time I didn't have the belief in myself that I could contribute to that field. That changed when I worked for my first startup in 2020.

I met so many kind and intelligent people, and I started believing in my personal ability more. I've been a tinkerer since I was a child, so I started off with the CompTIA A+ exam, then I took Harvard's CS50 Course. It sparked a hunger for learning in me that I hadn't felt prior. 

I stood up a Homelab starting with a Raspberry Pi because of course I did, it's practically a meme at this point for the homelab community. I've slowly used it to learn and experiement, please feel free to read all about it in my Homelab folder in this repository. 

I next enrolled in my local community college and started taking math and computer science courses. In Summer of 2024 I applied for the Computer Science program at University of Colorado Boulder, and I got in, I couldn't believe it. 

So that's where this repo comes in. As I continue through my Computer Science Education, my Homelab and learning Cybersecurity and earning certifications, please feel free to check in on my notes. Not only are they here to help me but hopefully they can be of use to you as well!

### OSI - Open Systems Interconnection

The OSI model is a conceptual model developed by the [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/sectors/it-technologies)

### Layer 1: Physical Layer

This layer is focused on physical connections, wire, gpio pins, fiber-optic cables, electrical connections, and surprisingly even WiFi is considered physical (the radio bands 2.4GHz and 5 GHz, and 6GHz)

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer

This layer is focused on ethernet, 802.3, 802.11. Here we find Media Access Control addresses or MAC Addresses.

MAC Addreses are expressed in six bytes (each pair is a byte or 8 bits) 

**a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d**

The first 3 bytes identify a vendor or OEM such as Intel, Xerox, etc.
The last 3 bytes identify a unique address on the network interface

### Layer 3: Network Layer

In the data link layer
